# Master's Thesis Project: Non-parametric Change Point Detection Using Q-Q Distance

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documents for the master's thesis project at the University of Glasgow. The research focuses on implementing and evaluating a non-parametric change point detection algorithm.

## Research Objectives
- Implement a non-parametric change point detection algorithm based on Q-Q distance
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods such as CUSUM
- Apply the method to real-world data (electricity price data) and verify its effectiveness
